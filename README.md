# StateChecker

StateChecker is an ACI app that will allow network operators to snapshot a subset of objects in the 
fabric and compare them. This will allow you to answer questions like:

* What changed in my fabric between windows 
* Are my critical objects the same after maintenance 
* Are all my routes/endpoints still present

StateChecker is available on the [appstore](https://aciappcenter.cisco.com/statechangechecker-2-2-1n.html)  
to be deployed on the Cisco ACI APIC and can also be deployed in standalone mode with the ability to 
connect remotely to an ACI fabric.  Further details can be found on 
[readthedocs](https://statechecker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
